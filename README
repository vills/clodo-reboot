Script to call API method to reboot your virtual server on Clodo

Because default $PATH on Clodo's servers is '/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin' we can substitute default reboot command by our own, if placed it at '/usr/local/sbin'.


REQUIREMENTS
============
curl
awk
sed
tr
bash


INSTALL
=======
Download file 'reboot', put it to /usr/local/sbin and change access modes to 500

# wget -O /usr/local/sbin/reboot https://raw.github.com/vills/clodo-reboot/master/reboot.sh
# chmod 500 /usr/local/sbin
(you must be logged as root)


USAGE
=====
Create file /root/.clodo-reboot with such content:
CLODO_USER="my_clodo_account"					# username at panel.clodo.ru
CLODO_KEY="3021e68df9a7200135725c6331369a22"	# key to access Clodo API

Make sure access permissions on that file meet your security needs.

When you wish to reboot your server, just execute "reboot" at console.
